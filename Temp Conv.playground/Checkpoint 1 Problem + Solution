// Your goal is to write a Swift playground that:
//Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius. 
//Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
//Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.
//You already know everything you need to solve that problem, but if you’d like some hints then I’ll add some below.


import Cocoa

let Celsius  = 35.0
let Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9.0 / 5.0 ) + 32

let forecast = "Today's Forecast is \(Celsius)°C & \(Fahrenheit)°F"

print(forecast)
